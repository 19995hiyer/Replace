# Replace
I am very new to GIThub and Python while using a function from os package called chdir, I saw a common problem that we cannot use "" to change the path I have tried to modify the use of this package by using a function through which user can replace his string "" with "/" which is accepted by python You can access the function by calling rep(r"path") and the directory would be changed
